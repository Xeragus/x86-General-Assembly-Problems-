Problem 5: Define an array of 10 elements of type data byte. The values (characters) of the
array are read from the keyboard. The array should be modified in order to keep only the
upper-case letters (A-Z) which is successor of a digit (Beside the first element in the array that
will stay in the array if it is an upper-case letter). The modified array should be printed on the
display.
Example:
If the array is: a2A21BC<2b, it should be modified into: AB.
